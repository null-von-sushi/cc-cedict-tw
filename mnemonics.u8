下水 下水 [xia4 shui5] /In butchering, after slaughtering an animal, the internal organs are removed and traditionally washed in water (to clean blood, stomach contents, etc.). Because these organs had to be “put into the water” (下水) as part of processing, the name stuck. So 下水 literally means “the parts that go down into water (to be cleaned)” → i.e. the internal organs or 'offal'./
磨合 磨合 [mo2 he2] /Literally “to rub and fit together”. Picture two gears just installed in a machine. They don’t align perfectly at first, but through friction, small adjustments, and repeated motion, they gradually smooth out and work seamlessly./
