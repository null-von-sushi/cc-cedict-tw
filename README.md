# 自由詞典

## An attempt to make a dictionary that doesn't ratify the vocabulary or pronounciations of the People's Republic of China, but instead endorse vocabulary used in free areas.

Specifically, this dictionary will have the followding main differeces/goals compared to CC-CEDICT:

- Use the pronounciation from the Republic of China (Taiwan) where applicable.
- Incorporate any slang or neologisms used by the international community that isn't already in CC-CEDICT (such as terms used by BBC, ABC or similar communities).
- Edit any definitions, if neessary (in practice, this has not been necessary as CC-CEDIT has done an amazing job at keeping the language politically neutral. Of course, a dictionary is big, so if something pops up in the future, it will be dealt with accordingly. In the interest of transparency, this readme will be updated to include a list of words with their description altered in meaning.
Regarding this, the only major edits have been that some words have had `(PRC)` added, while the `(Tw)` ones had it removed to indicate which is the *default*.

Please note that this project is not endorsed by any organization or any peoples. I am doing this for myself mostly, out of personal interest as I believe that other dictionaries are biased towards PRC style Chinese. This is my attempt to balance the scales. 
If you are not interested in this, feel free to use CC-CEDICT (the upstream), Pleco, Hanping or search on Baidu itself.
