# 自由詞典

## An attempt to make a dictionary that doesn't ratify the vocabulary or pronounciations of the People's Republic of China, but instead uses vocabulary often found in free areas.

Specifically, this dictionary will have the followding main differeces/goals compared to CC-CEDICT:

- Use the pronounciation from the Republic of China (Taiwan) where applicable.
- Incorporate any slang or neologisms used by the international community that isn't already in CC-CEDICT (such as terms used by BBC, ABC or similar communities). This will include Cantonese or Japanese slang or loanwords.
- Edit any major definitions, if neessary (in practice, this has not been necessary as CC-CEDIT has done an amazing job at keeping the language politically neutral. Of course, a dictionary is big, so if something pops up in the future, it will be dealt with accordingly. Most changes will be in new words added, old ones mostly just change to switch the focus on the ROC usage of the word as default, while having the PRC usage as a sidenote. For a list of changes just check the commit history. 

Please note that this project is not endorsed by any organization or any peoples. I am doing this for myself mostly, out of personal interest as I believe that other dictionaries are biased towards PRC style Chinese. This is my attempt to balance the scales. 
If you are not interested in this, feel free to use CC-CEDICT (the upstream), Pleco, Hanping or search on Baidu itself. Or use one of the bazillion mainland-China-centric dictionaries that exist.

# Style guide / common abreviations
 - As CC-CEDICT started it, we will keep things lowercase by default
 - `PRC pr.` is used to indicated the pronounciation used in the area controlled by the People's Republic of China. Meanwhile `Tw. ` indicates something is relating to Taiwan.
 - `(slang)` indicates it's slang while `(neologism)` indicates it's a newly created word
 - `(from XXX)` indicates the source language a term comes from. This is usually appended to words that have their roots in Cantonese, Japanese or even Taiwanese.
